# 🤖 Ethical AI Bias Detector

A Streamlit-based web application that helps detect bias in machine learning models using user-uploaded datasets. This tool highlights fairness concerns by identifying performance discrepancies across sensitive attributes like gender, race, etc.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload any CSV dataset  
- 🎯 Choose target column for prediction  
- ⚖️ Choose sensitive attribute to analyze bias  
- 🧠 Logistic Regression-based model training  
- 📊 Overall model accuracy and group-wise performance  
- 📉 Bias gap calculation with fairness warnings  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Upload a dataset (CSV)
2. Choose your target and sensitive feature
3. The app will:
   - Preprocess the data
   - Train a simple ML model
   - Evaluate fairness using group accuracy
   - Show a **bias gap score** and suggestions

---

## 🧪 Example Output

🎯 Overall Accuracy: 0.82
📉 Bias Gap (Max - Min Accuracy): 0.27
⚠️ High bias detected! Consider rebalancing or debiasing methods.
